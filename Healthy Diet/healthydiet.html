<pre style="font-family:'Lucida Bright	';color:#79F6FC"><font size='5'>In India, a typical meal pattern includes a substantial breakfast usually eaten between 7-9am,
 a large lunch around midday (12-2pm), and a lighter dinner generally consumed between 7-8pm,
 with the emphasis on eating moderately in the morning, eating well at lunchtime, and eating very little at night,
 often following Ayurvedic principles of balanced eating throughout the day.
Breakfast:
Commonly includes items like dosa, idli, vada (South India), paratha, poha, eggs, and various types of savory pancakes depending on the region. 
Lunch:
Considered the main meal, often featuring rice, lentils (dal), vegetables, roti (flatbread), curries, and sometimes non-vegetarian options. 
Dinner:
Usually lighter, with smaller portions of easily digestible food like dals, yogurt, salads, or vegetable-based dishes.  <pre>
